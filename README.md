# Machine-Learning-System
This was a capstone project for my computer science degree.
A machine learning model that takes a data set of songs and song features and determines the similarity between a song being searched and the songs in the set.
Once a user searches for a song, the program will provide a list of songs that are most similar to the searched song based on similarity scores.
